# sipNcode-Spotify-API

In the main.py file we perform a post request to get an access token from Spotify's Web API. Then we perform two get requests to get an artist's top 10 songs by country and their related artists.

While the client_id and client_secret is stored in main.py, it is more appropriate to store environment variables in an .env file. Here's a video tutorial detailing how to do that in VSCode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txGL-Ld9zD8&ab_channel=dcode

Find endpoints on the web API's reference page at: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api

I've also included the slideshow that provides basic information about what an API is.
